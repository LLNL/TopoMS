##### Author: Harsh Bhatia, hbhatia@llnl.gov; Attila G Gyulassy

TopoMS is a computational tool for detailed topological analysis of molecular
and condensed matter systems, including the computation of atomic volumes and
charges through the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (also known as Bader
analysis), as well as the complete molecular graph.  With roots in techniques
from computational topology, and using a shared-memory parallel approach,
TopoMS provides scalable, numerically robust, and topologically consistent
analysis.

If you use TopoMS, please cite the following publication.

TopoMS can be used as a command-line tool (`./topoms`) or with a GUI
(`./topoms-ui`), where the latter also enables an interactive exploration of
the molecular graph.

TopoMS requires a configuration file to provide several important parameters
for analysis. Both applications take a single command-line input -- the
configuration file name. A detailed example of configuration file is
provided in the `./configs` folder.

### Installation

TopoMS requires a `gnu` C++ compiler (preferably `gcc 7.3`). Note that for Mac,
the default `gcc` is in fact `clang`. Unless you have it configured otherwise,
you need to set the path of `gnu` compiler explicitly (see below). TopoMS
requires Visualization Toolkit (VTK) in order to output molecular graphs.
Although optional, `VTK 7.1.1` is strongly suggested as a dependency.

In addition, `TopoMS-UI` also requires `Qt`, `OpenGL`, and `QGLViewer`. Please
note that Qt often changes the API substantially between versions; the recommended
version is `Qt 5.7`. Qt is available through a number of package managers. For
example, for Mac, you can use `macports` to get Qt: `port install qt57`.
The required version for `QGLViewer` is `2.7`.

To simplify installation, scripts have been provided to build `TopoMS` as well
as `TopoMS-UI` along with their dependencies. Please see the usage below.
Additional instructions for individual installation are provided separately in
the respective folders, `topoms` and `topoms-ui`.

```
$ pwd
<your-path>/TopoMS
$ export GNU_CXX=/opt/local/bin/g++  # example path;    needed only for Mac
$ sh install.topoms.sh
$ sh install.topoms-ui.sh
```

`TopoMS` executables will be installed in `<your-path>\TopoMS\build`, and
dependencies (`VTK` and `libQGLViewer`) will be installed in `<your-path>\TopoMS\external`.
